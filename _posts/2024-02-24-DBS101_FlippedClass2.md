### Topic : Entity Relationship Diagram

During the flipped class, I had a clear picture of the ER Diagram or modeling why it is important to us, and how to make one.

A technique or approach called an entity-relationship diagram (ER diagram) is used to depict the relationships between various entities (real-world objects ) and their attributes (characteristics) in order to create and display the logical structure of a database. For it to ensure sure that the database fulfills user needs and works effectively, it is essential for the fields of software engineering, database design, and data system administration. 

Defining the entities and their attributes could be an initial step towards creating an ER diagram. Following that, we create the relationships—one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many—between these entities. Relations are vital because they make clear the interactions between things. For proper comprehension between branches, it's critical to properly identify each item, characteristic, and connection.

As therefore, the ER diagram is a lot more than merely a theoretical exercise; it has actual applications in a variety of areas, including  social networking, e-commerce, healthcare, and education, and it can be used to create functional database systems that fulfill the needs of their users and applications.

Firstly, our group was assigned in with the making of the ER diagram of airline ticketing and then, we started with understanding of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. 

With the context of an airline ticketing system, entities might include Passengers, Flights, Tickets, and Airlines. Attributes for these entities could include PassengerID, Name, ContactInfo for Passengers; FlightID, Departure, Arrival for Flights; and TicketID, Price, PassengerID, FlightID for Tickets. 
Relationships might involve one-to-many or many-to-many connections between entities, such as a Passenger can book many Tickets, and a Flight can have many Tickets. 
Using a diagramming tool, we started drawing the entities as rectangles, attributes as ovals, and relationships as diamonds. Using lines to connect the entities with relationships, and indicate cardinality at the ends of the relationships. 
About the relations and cardinalities, it can be
ne-to-many or many-to-many connections, etc as it depends upon the systemfor example, a passenger can book many tickets, a flight can have many tickets and a reservation is associated with one ticket and one passenger.

At last, we did a short presentation and explained to our friends and also got some comments on how can we imporve our ER diagram.
