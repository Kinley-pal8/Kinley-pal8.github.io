### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
----

#### Things I Learned in this lesson:-
The lesson was about the roles of database administrators and different types of database users.
The stuff that I learned during the period of the lesson is listed below:
I am aware of the roles of database administrators, they are:

1. Coordinating the interactions among service providers and database suppliers.

2. Carrying out regular database system audits.

3. Developing, carrying out, and defending policies.

4. Give database-related technical help to other IT personnel as well as end users.

5. Establishing and maintaining data flow diagrams and dictionaries.

6. Recognizing, investigating, and promptly fixing database problems.

7. Working with those in need of data in developing a database that fulfills their requirements. creating database solutions that fit the requirements of the individuals involved.

8. Ensuring that databases are set up for efficient information retrieval and storage.

Therefore, Database Administrators (DBAs) play a multifaceted role in the management and maintenance of database systems.
This bunch of information was given by my fellow mates and because of them, I'm familiar with the roles.

Next, the different types of database users namely:
Database Administrator: They oversee and maintain database systems to make sure they run effectively and safely. This, guarantees the database's security, optimum operation, and routine backups.

1. Naive or Parametric End Users: These are Users of banking systems or ticketing services, low-level users who frequently use database applications in their daily tasks but lack DBMS knowledge.

2. Sophisticated Users: These users possess knowledge of databases and can create their database applications. Instead of writing the program code, they use the query processor to write SQL queries that directly interact with the database.

3. System analysts: They examine end user's requirements to make sure all of their needs are satisfied. They act as a bridge between users and the database 

4. Database designers: These users build the tables, stored procedures, triggers, views, and constraints that make up the database's system. 

5. Application Programmers: These users write code for application programs that communicate with databases. They are also referred to as System Analysts or Software Engineers.

6. Temporary or Casual Users: These users access the database from time to time and each time they do so, they require new information.

7. Specialized Users: Advanced users who create unique database applications that resist the norms of traditional data processing.

Lastly, I learned the functions of DBA where it plays a crucial role in designing, implementing, managing, and maintaining databases.

#### Things I did in my flipped class:-
Firstly, I had already learned the different types of database users before coming to the class. I had made some notes on it and during the 15 minutes of the flipped class, I just searched for some extra points to add on and then, I shared it with my peers and discussed it within ourselves.

#### How the flipped class can be improved:-
The flipped class can be improved by:
-using pre-class quizzes 
-delivering a variety of material kinds, such as interactive modules, videos, etc to accommodate different ways of learning.
