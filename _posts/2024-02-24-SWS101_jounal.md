### Topic : Journal entry: Exploring security in the OverTheWire Bandit

Today marks the completion of levels 0 to 9 in the game OverTheWire Bandit, which is an exciting journey into cybersecurity and Unix systems Considering the challenges and discoveries we encountered along the way, I with new knowledge and understanding a deep in system security concepts

Level 0: .
The initial level introduced me to SSH (Secure Shell) and basic command-line communication. After connecting to the Bandit server, I figured out the syntax and functionality of the SSH command. The password was readily available, and was a gentle introduction to the mechanics of the game.

Level 1 to 5:
These levels improved my understanding of file conversion commands like ls, cd, cat, and file. I have encountered situations where I had to navigate directories, read files, and show files in order to make progress. Additionally, I learned about identifying hidden files with a leading dot (.) and how to identify them with the -a flag containing ls.

Level 6 to 9:
As I delved deeper into access, ownership, and symbolic communication, the challenges grew. I considered the importance of the file path represented by the r, w, and x flags for reading, writing, and killing, respectively. By using commands like chmod, chown, and find, I gained the ability to change permissions and ownership of files and directories.
