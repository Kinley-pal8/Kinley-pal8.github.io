### Topic : Journal entry: Exploring security in the OverTheWire Bandit

Today marks the completion of levels 0 to 9 in the game OverTheWire Bandit, which is an exciting journey into cybersecurity and Unix systems Considering the challenges and discoveries we encountered along the way, I with new knowledge and understanding a deep in system security concepts

Level 0: .
The initial level introduced me to SSH (Secure Shell) and basic command-line communication. After connecting to the Bandit server, I figured out the syntax and functionality of the SSH command. The password was readily available, and was a short introduction to the mechanics of the game.

Level 1 to 5:
These levels improved my understanding of file conversion commands like ls, cd, cat, and file. I have encountered situations where I had to navigate directories, read files, and show files in order to make progress. Additionally, I learned about identifying hidden files with a leading dot (.) and how to identify them with the -a flag containing ls.

Level 6 to 9:
As I got deeper into access, ownership, and symbolic communication, the challenges grew. I considered the importance of the file path represented by the r, w, and x flags for reading, writing, and killing, respectively. By using commands like chmod, chown, and find, I gained the ability to change permissions and ownership of files and directories.

The walk through from level 10 to 20:

Level 10:

The password is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.
Solution:
ls to list the files in the current directory.
cat data.txt to display the contents of data.txt.
The password is found by searching for the word millionth in the file.

Level 11:

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded in Base64.
Solution:
'ls' to list the files in the current directory.
'cat' data.txt to display the contents of data.txt.
'grep' to filter out the Base64 encoded strings.
'base64 -d' to decode the Base64 encoded strings.


Level 12:
The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded in ASCII Hex.
Solution:
'ls' to list the files in the current directory.
'cat' data.txt to display the contents of data.txt.
'grep' to filter out the ASCII Hex encoded strings.
'xxd -r -p' to decode the ASCII Hex encoded strings.

Level 13:

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with the Caesar cipher.
Solution:
'ls', 'cat' and 'grep' are used in all level for the first three steps.
Use tr to decode the Caesar cipher. For example, tr 'A-Za-z' 'B-Za-yb-za-y' to shift the alphabet by 1.

Level 14: 

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with the Caesar cipher.
Solution:
Use tr to decode the Caesar cipher. For example, tr 'A-Za-z' 'B-Za-yb-za-y' to shift the alphabet by 1.

Level 15: 

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with the SDA.
Solution:
Use sed or awk to decode the SDA.


Level 16:

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with AES.
Solution:
Use openssl to decode the AES encoded strings.

Level 17: 

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with a combination of different ciphers.
Solution:
Use tr, sed, awk, base64, xxd, and openssl to decode the strings step by step.

Level 18: 

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded in a different base.
Solution:
Use base64, xxd, or tr to decode the strings based on the base mentioned.

Level 19:

The password is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, encoded with a combination of different ciphers.
Solution:
Use tr, sed, awk, base64, xxd, and openssl to decode the strings step by step.

Level 20: 

The password is stored as same as in level 19.
Solution:
Use tr, sed, awk, base64, xxd, and openssl to decode the strings step by step.

This journey through the Bandit game series has been incredibly educational, offering practical insights into Linux and cybersecurity. I look forward to applying these lessons in real-world scenarios and further exploring the depths of the game.
